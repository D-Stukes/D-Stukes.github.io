          <h2>My Brand</h2>
          <h3> Fiercely committed, yet warm and personable.
            Those who know me have described me as “faithful, kind, tenacious, and a leader.”
            I love being creative and presenting information in a beautiful way, while on the other hand, navigating and affecting the inner workings
            of the backend towards optimum production is also important to me which fuels my passions for the web development field. (With a background in technical writing along with my experiences at General Assembly I have equipped myself with skills and
            knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Node, Express, PSQL, and React JS.
            I love to keep growing, for life never stands still
